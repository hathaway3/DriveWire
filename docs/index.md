# Before you start

DriveWire 4 is a 100% compatible drop in replacement for the DriveWire 3 software. The requirements for connecting a CoCo to DriveWire 4 are identical to those for DriveWire 3. 

Please consult the [DriveWire 3 documentation](http://www.frontiernet.net/~mmarlette/Cloud-9/Software/DriveWire3.html) for all the information needed to get your CoCo ready to talk to DriveWire 4. 

# Get started with DriveWire 4

## Step 1: Download the DriveWire 4 software

Download the current version from [the DriveWire 4 website](http://sites.google.com/site/drivewire4/)

  


## Step 2: Install DriveWire 4

Installing DriveWire 4 just means unpacking the zip file where ever you'd like. There is no installation program to run. 

DriveWire 4 requires a Java JRE to be installed and working on your system. If you don't have one, you can visit http://www.java.com/getjava/ and follow the prompts.

  * Windows users can double click on DW4UI.exe or DW4UI.jar
