## Support

!!! note "Generalization (Review Needed)"
    The following section has been updated to reflect the multi-language nature of the project.

    Modern DriveWire implementations are available in several languages (Java, MicroPython, etc.). While we've done quite a bit of testing, there are certainly going to be issues that come up only as the software is tried by more people. 

You can often find other users of DW online in our IRC channel, `#coco_chat` on freenode. To join the room with your web browser, [click here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=coco_chat).
