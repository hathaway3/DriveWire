Revised information coming soon, apologies to anyone who attempted to use the old instructions recently, they were not correct and I'd forgotten they were still online here. 

## Notes

You still need to have the correct RXTX library file for your platform. You also must have the .properties configuration files in the same folder as your single DirveWire.jar file. 

You should be able to launch the drivewire server with the normal ‘java –jar DriveWire.jar’ command on any platform. 

The jar file is platform independent, so once it is built you can copy to windows, linux, mac os etc without rebuilding and run it. Requirements: 

Java version 1.5 or later Apache Ant configured for your platform
