# Building from Source

> [!WARNING]
> These instructions may be outdated.

You need to have the correct RXTX library file for your platform. You also must have the `.properties` configuration files in the same folder as your single `DriveWire.jar` file.

You should be able to launch the DriveWire server with the normal `java –jar DriveWire.jar` command on any platform.

The jar file is platform independent, so once it is built you can copy it to Windows, Linux, macOS, etc. without rebuilding.

## Requirements

- Java version 1.5 or later
- Apache Ant configured for your platform
