!!! note "Generalization (Review Needed)"
    The following guide has been updated to cover the general installation concepts for DriveWire server software.

    This guide covers the installation of the DriveWire server software.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: You will need a suitable cable to connect your CoCo to your PC. See [DriveWire Cables](DriveWire_cables.md).
- **Client Software**:
    - For CoCo: [Client (CoCo) Side Software](Client_CoCo.md)
    - For Non-CoCo: [Client (Non-CoCo) Side Software](Client_Non_CoCo.md)
    - Alternative: [Add DriveWire drivers to existing system](Add_DriveWire_Drivers.md)

## Installation

!!! note "Generalization (Review Needed)"
    Simplified installation description.

    Installing the DriveWire server often just means unpacking an archive wherever you'd like. Most implementations do not require a formal installation program.

## Requirements

!!! note "Generalization (Review Needed)"
    Generalized requirements to indicate they are implementation-specific (primarily Java).

    The Java-based DriveWire server requires a Java JRE to be installed and working on your system. If you don't have one, you can visit [java.com](http://www.java.com/getjava/) and follow the prompts. Other builds, such as the MicroPython version, have different requirements.

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to [Running DriveWire](index.md#step-3-run-drivewire).
